# React Application with Context API, Material UI, React Router, and more

## Overview

This React application is built with various features and technologies to enhance user experience and functionality. It incorporates Context API (Redux pattern), Material UI for styling, React Router for navigation, Google Custom Search API for instant search results, and Firebase for authentication and hosting.

## Features

### 1. Context API (Redux)

The application utilizes the Context API, following the Redux pattern, to manage global state efficiently. This ensures a centralized state management system for better organization and scalability.

### 2. Material UI

Material UI is used for styling and theming the application. This popular React UI framework provides a set of pre-designed components, making it easier to create a consistent and visually appealing user interface.

### 3. React Router

React Router is employed for seamless navigation within the application. It enables the creation of dynamic, single-page applications with smooth transitions between different views.

### 4. Instant Search Page

The application features a search page that provides instant results without the need for page refreshing. This is achieved through efficient state management and data fetching, providing users with a responsive and dynamic search experience.

### 5. Google Custom Search API

To power the search functionality, the Google Custom Search API is integrated into the application. This allows users to search for relevant content with the reliability of Google's search algorithms.

### 6. Custom Hooks with React

Custom hooks are created within the application to encapsulate and reuse logic. This promotes code reusability and helps in keeping the codebase clean and modular.

### 7. Firebase Integration

Firebase is used to set up the application for authentication with Google. This ensures secure and easy access to the application using Google credentials.

### 8. Firebase Hosting

The application is deployed using Firebase Hosting, providing a scalable and reliable hosting solution. Firebase Hosting allows for easy deployment, hosting, and maintenance of the React application.
